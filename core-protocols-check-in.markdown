# Check In

Use Check In to begin meetings or anytime an individual or group Check In would add more value to the current team interactions.

### Steps

1. Speaker says “I feel [one or more of MAD, SAD, GLAD, AFRAID].” Speaker may provide a brief explanation. Or if others have already checked in, the speaker may say “I pass.” (See the  [Pass](http://liveingreatness.com/core-protocols/pass-unpass/) protocol.)
2. Speaker says “I’m in.” This signifies that Speaker intends to behave according to the Core Commitments.
3. Listeners respond, “Welcome.”

### Commitments

- State feelings without qualification.
- State feelings only as they pertain to yourself.
- Be silent during another’s Check In.
- Do not refer to another’s Check In disclosures without explicitly granted permission from him or her.

### Notes

- In the context of the Core Protocols, all emotions are expressed through combinations of MAD, SAD, GLAD, or AFRAID. For example, “excited” may be a combination of GLAD and AFRAID.
- Check In as deeply as possible. Checking in with two or more emotions is the norm. The depth of a group’s Check In translates directly to the quality of the group’s results.
- Do not do anything to diminish your emotional state. Do not describe yourself as a “little” mad, sad, glad, or afraid or say “I’m mad, but I’m still glad.”
- Except in large groups, if more than one person checks in, it is recommended that all do so.
- HAPPY may be substituted for GLAD, and SCARED may be substituted for AFRAID.
